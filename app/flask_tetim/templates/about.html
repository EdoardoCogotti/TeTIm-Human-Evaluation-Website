            This game is about recognize if a picture is “Real” or AI-generated using as unique input the caption above the image.
            “Real” means a photo taken by a person (the place/food/person does exist) or a drawing made by a human artist. Each game is composed by 20 images.
            <br>
            In recent years the field of generating images from text has seen unprecedented growth, with numerous text-to-image techniques being developed.
            Synthetic images are a huge opportunity, but they can be also a threat.
            <br>
            Recently a knock-off free version of the AI system DALL-E, DALLE-E mini, went viral on social media with funny images and memes.

            This free model is limited and results are often clumsy. But the current state-of-the-art in this field is different and improve results day by day.
            Browsing the Internet, we know that a text could be generated by a bot, but what if even synthetic images were credible?  Nobody took that realistic
            photo and nobody drew that painting, but it is the result of an AI system.
            <br>
            But what does it mean “credible”? Mathematical metrics such as FID or CLIP score can be used to understand the likely that an image is real,
            but they are limited metrics. An image that presents some artifacts can achieve a good score, but it doesn’t result credible for the human perception.
            For instance, we are very sensitive about human faces and even a good AI-generated face image could be recognize and provoke an uncanny feeling
            (indeed this effect is known as Uncanny valley)

            This game challenge you about the credibility of the images generated by the current text-to-image models in different categories:

            If your score will be sufficiently high, you can save it using a nickname in the “High score” section.
